Project to compute NO2 photolysis rate coeï¬ƒcients for zenith angles in the table of actinic fluxes. Parses data from multiple sources to calculate the NO2 photolysis rate coefficient as a function of the cosine of the zenith angle and subsequently predict the rate coefficient at various times of day.
